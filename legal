Instead of offering the Bridge Services directly to the public, we do business through companies who want to offer their customers the ability to buy and sell Stablecoins through their website or mobile application (“Partners”). To do so, our Partners integrate their services (the “Partner Services”) with the Bridge Services and brand the Bridge Services with their name and logo. This means you need to have a valid account with a Partner (a “Partner Account”) if you want to open a Bridge Account.</p><p>‍<br/>1.2. To be eligible to apply for and use a Bridge Account, you must: (a) be at least 18 years old, (b) have the legal capacity to agree to these terms; and (c) have an active Partner Account. If you are opening a Bridge Account for a Business User, you warrant and represent to us that: (i) you are authorized by the Business User to open a Bridge Account, (ii) you are an executive officer of the Business User; or (iii) your position permits you to make important decisions for the Business User. If you are a Business User, you may only use the Bridge Services for commercial purposes.</p><p>‍</p><p>1.3. We cannot provide a Bridge Account to you if you live in or do business in a state or country where we or our Financial Partners do not provide the Bridge Services (“Restricted Locations”). We can add or remove Restricted Locations from the list at any time without notifying you. We also comply with all applicable sanctions laws, so we are unable to provide the Bridges Services to you if you live in a country, or you are on a list of persons banned by any governmental authority with jurisdiction over you, Bridge and/or Bridge’s affiliates (including (without limitation) the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control, the UN Security Council, Her Majesty’s Treasury and the UK’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation and Department of International Trade) from doing business with person or companies relevant to these terms.</p><p>‍</p><p>1.4. We need certain Personal Data from you to verify your identity, to process your Bridge Account application, and to provide the Bridge Services to you. Your Partner may share your Personal Data with us with your permission, or we may collect it from you directly. Personal Data may include your name, email address, residential address, phone number, date of birth, and taxpayer identification number, copies of your passport, driver’s license, military identification card or other government-issued photo identification; bank account statements; cryptocurrency wallet addresses you control, the purpose of your use of the Bridge Services, the source of funds you use to buy or sell Stablecoins, and related information we request. We may keep records of your Personal Data if required by a Financial Partners or by applicable law. The Personal Data you provide must always be accurate, complete and up to date.</p><p>‍</p><p>1.5. You will only be able to access your Bridge Account using the username and password associated with your Partner Account (your “Login Credentials”). We are not responsible (and you will not hold us responsible) for any unauthorized access to or use of your Login Credentials, your Partner Account, or your Bridge Account. We do not have access to your Partner Account, and we cannot retrieve or change your Login Credentials. Contact the Partner immediately if you become aware of or suspect any unauthorized access to your Partner Account. ‍ 1.6 NEITHER WE NOR OUR FINANCIAL PARTNERS ARE LIABLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR ACTIVITY TO YOUR BRIDGE ACCOUNT. We will treat any unauthorized access or activity as potentially fraudulent, and you must notify the Partner within 24 hours if you become aware of or suspect potentially fraudulent activity. When you notify the Partner of potentially fraudulent activity, we and the Partner will temporarily restrict access to your Bridge Account, suspend any pending Orders or withdrawals, require you to change your Login Credentials, and any other reasonable steps to protect your Bridge Account. You must also (a) promptly report any potentially fraudulent activity to legal authorities; (b) provide the Partner with a copy of any report prepared by such legal authorities; (c) cooperate fully with the legal authorities, Partner and Bridge in the investigation; (d) complete any required affidavits promptly, accurately and thoroughly; and (e) allow Bridge, the Partner, or any third party designated by us access to your mobile device, computer, and network if relevant to the investigation.</p></div></div><div class="legal-index-content-wrap"><div class="legal-header"><h3><span class="text-color-grey">02</span></h3><h3>Funding Wallets and Wallets.</h3></div><div class="text-size-large w-richtext"><p>2.1.

To process Orders, you must provide at least one cryptocurrency wallet address from which to fund Orders (your “Funding Wallet”), and/or at least one cryptocurrency wallet address (your “Receiving Wallet”) to receive the Stablecoins you purchase, as applicable. Your Funding Wallet and/or your Receiving Wallet must be under your sole ownership or control, and we have the right to suspend Orders if we suspect that you do not own or control your Funding Wallet or your Receiving Wallet. We may ask you for information about the financial institution or other provider of your Receiving Wallet and your Funding Wallet. If your Funding Wallet or Receiving Wallet is not provided to you by a regulated financial institution (a “Self-Directed Wallet”), we may ask you for more information about the Self-Directed Wallet and your Orders may be delayed or even blocked. We reserve the right to cancel or reverse purchase Orders if you use a Self-Directed Wallet. You authorize us to share Personal Data and Order information with the financial institution providers of your Funding Wallet and/or Receiving Wallet.<br/>‍<br/>2.2. As part of our legal compliance program (“AML/CTF Compliance Program”), we will monitor use of your Receiving Wallet, and review your Personal Data on an ongoing basis to prevent financial crimes. <br/>‍<br/>2.3. You are solely responsible for monitoring your Funding Wallet and Receiving Wallet for unauthorized or suspicious activity, and we are not liable to you if you lose your funds due to unauthorized activity. To protect your Funding Wallet and Receiving Wallet from unauthorized activity, you must: (a) review your Order history on an ongoing basis; (b) immediately review Order receipts, confirmations and notices we send you through your Partner Account or to the email address associated with your Partner Account; and (c) verify you received an Order confirmation, and (d) notify the Partner within 24 hours of the Order if you do not receive an Order confirmation.</p></div></div><div class="legal-index-content-wrap"><div class="legal-header"><h3><span class="text-color-grey">03</span></h3><h3>Bridge Account Suspension and Termination</h3></div><div class="text-size-large w-richtext"><p>‍3.1.

We will complete any active Orders by transferring the applicable Stablecoins to your Funding Wallet or your Receiving Wallet, as applicable, before closing your Bridge Account. <br/>‍<br/>3.2. We may immediately reject transactions to or from, suspend or terminate, your Bridge Account and/or freeze any funds without prior notice if: (a) we suspect you have violated these terms, our AML/CTF Compliance Program, or any applicable laws or regulations; (b) we are required to do so by applicable law or by any valid order we receive from law enforcement officials; (c) we or your Partner suspect any suspicious or unauthorized activity or any actual or attempted unauthorized access to your Partner Account or Login Credentials; (d) Your Partner Account has been suspended or terminated or you no longer have access to your Partner Account; (e) you no longer reside in a jurisdiction where we are authorized to provide the Bridge Services; (f) you do not connect at least one Funding Wallet with your Bridge Account, and (g) you have not processed any Orders or you have not accessed your Bridge Account for more than 1 year.

The computer networks used to exchange Digital Assets are called “Blockchains”. We may also permit you to buy Stablecoins that are compatible with one or more cryptographic protocols. A list of Digital Assets and Stablecoins we support are available via your Partner Account. We do not support the purchase of any Digital Assets that are not Stablecoins. We may remove a Digital Asset or Stablecoin due to changes in the characteristics or regulatory classification of the asset, or for any other reason at any time. If we delist a Stablecoin while an Order is in process, we will reverse your Order and return the funds you used to pay for the Order to your Funding Wallet or to your Receiving Wallet, as applicable. If you send funds to Bridge that are not supported, these funds will be lost.

We do not operate, own, or control any Blockchains. By their nature, Blockchains use open-source software that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute. Neither we nor your Partner are responsible for the operation of any Blockchains that are compatible with the Stablecoins and Digital Assets we support, and we do not guarantee the functionality, security, or availability of any Blockchains. Some of the financial institutions that issue Stablecoins on various Blockchains (“Issuers”) include software code that they can use to block the transfer of Stablecoins if the Issuer suspects illegal activity or pursuant to a request from law enforcement. We have no control over the software code of any of the Stablecoins we support, and you are purchasing Stablecoins at your own risk.<br/>‍<br/>5.2. Blockchains are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, and third parties may from time to time create a copy of a Blockchain and implement changes in operating rules or other features (“Forks”) that may result in more than one version of a Blockchain (each, a “Forked Blockchain”) and more than one version of a Stablecoin (“Forked Stablecoins”) or Digital Asset (“Forked Asset”). Our ability to support Forked Stablecoins or accept Forked Assets resulting from a Forked Network is completely outside our control. Forks may materially affect the value and function of the Stablecoins you purchase from or sell to us and depends entirely on the Issuer of the Forked Stablecoin. In the event of a Fork, we may temporarily suspend any Orders in process at the time of the Fork with or without notice to you while we determine the effects of the Fork on the functionality of the Bridge Services. Issuers will almost certainly not support Forked versions of the Stablecoins they issue, and you may not be permitted to redeem Forked Stablecoins for another Stablecoin or other Digital Asset. Attempts to Fork a Blockchain may also result in complete or partial failure of the Blockchain’s functionality, and the Stablecoins and Digital Assets you own that are supported by the Blockchain may become worthless.<br/>‍<br/>WE MAY CHOOSE NOT TO SUPPORT FORKED BLOCKCHAINS, AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT, CLAIM, OR OTHER PRIVILEGE TO FORKED STABLECOINS ON A FORKED NETWORK WE DO NOT SUPPORT, EVEN IN THE RARE EVENT AN ISSUER SUPPORTS THE FORK. WE MAY ABANDON OR CHOOSE NOT TO SUPPORT FORKED BLOCKCHAINS AS PART OF THE BRIDGE SERVICES, AND WE ARE UNLIKELY TO SUPPORT MOST FORKED BLOCKCHAINS. IF YOU USE A DIGITAL ASSET THAT HAS BEEN FORKED TO BUY STABLECOINS FROM US, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CANCEL YOUR ORDER, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETURN YOUR FUNDS IN THE EVENT OF A FAILED FORK.<br/>‍<br/>5.3. THERE ARE MANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BUYING AND SELLING STABLECOINS. WE HAVE DESCRIBED THESE RISKS IN OUR STABLECOIN RISK DISCLOSURE AVAILABLE IN EXHIBIT B TO THIS AGREEMENT. THE STABLECOIN RISK DISCLOSURE IS INCLUDED IN THESE TERMS, AND BY USING THE BRIDGE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING TO US THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THESE RISKS.</p></div></div><div class="legal-index-content-wrap"><div class="legal-header"><h3><span class="text-color-grey">06</span></h3><h3>Orders</h3></div><div class="text-size-large w-richtext"><p>6.1. Placing Orders. You can only place Orders through your Partner Account using your Login Credentials. If we receive an Order from you, we will assume you intended for us to execute the Order. All purchase Orders require full payment in cleared funds at the time we fill your Order. Do not place an Order to purchase Stablecoins with other Stablecoins if you don’t have enough funds in your Funding Wallet. We will not process Orders to purchase Stablecoins with Digital Assets or other Stablecoins before we receive the Digital Assets or Stablecoins from you.  We do not guarantee that we will fill your Order, and we reserve the right to cancel any Order or part of an Order for any reason, including if the Order: (a) was placed during a scheduled or unscheduled downtime of Bridge or Company; (v) violates these terms; or (c) is non-marketable.<br/>‍<br/>6.2. Source of Funds; Destination of Proceeds; Order Limits. We only authorize Orders using funds in a Funding Wallet or Receiving Wallet you control. You are not allowed to use funds that do not belong to you to place Orders, and that you cannot place Orders on behalf of a third party. Each time you place an Order, you are promising that all you own the funds used by you to execute an Order, and that the funds are not the direct or indirect proceeds of any criminal or fraudulent activity. When we receive funds for your Order, title to those funds transfers to Bridge upon receipt. When we send to you proceeds from your Order, title to those funds transfer to you upon your receipt of those funds. Any proceeds from the sale of Stablecoins will be Funding Wallet or to your Receiving Wallet, and that you will not have the option to transfer proceeds to any other bank account, including a bank account that you own. Neither Bridge nor Company will hold any sale proceeds on your behalf. We may limit the amount and frequency of your Orders (in USD terms) in a given time period. These limits may depend on when you opened your Bridge Account, the Personal Data you provided us, and a variety of other risk factors.<br/>‍<br/>6.3.  Order Receipts and Order History. When we fill your Order, the Partner will send you a confirmation (the “Order Receipt”) on our behalf through your Partner Account or to the email address associated with your Partner Account or we will send one directly to that email address. We may choose without prior notice to you, to periodically consolidate multiple Orders into a single Order Receipt. You may request your Order history by emailing support@bridge.xyz. We maintain records of all Orders for a period of seven years or as otherwise required by applicable law.<br/>‍<br/>6.4. Right to Offset. If you fail to provide sufficient funds at the time we fill your Order, we reserve the right to cancel, reverse or fill the Order in whole or in part. You agree to be responsible for the costs of any such action we take, including gas and exchange fees. You will also be responsible for such costs if you cancel your transaction prior to processing and we return funds to you. If your failure to provide sufficient funds or a return results in an amount due and owing by you to us (a “Negative Balance”), we have the right to: (a) charge a reasonable rate of interest on the Negative Balance; (b) offset any Negative Balance and any accrued interest and other losses by debiting funds from your Funding Wallet in the amount of the Negative Balance; and (c) offset any Negative Balance against amounts we owe you for Stablecoins we purchase from you, Stablecoins you have purchased from us, or funds you have requested to be returned.<br/>‍<br/>6.5. Cancellations; Errors. You may not cancel an Order after we have commenced processing it. If you cancel your Order and you have not provided sufficient information in order for us to return your funds, we will hold your funds as required by law. You are solely responsible for reviewing your Order Receipts for accuracy and for monitoring your Order History for any errors or any potentially fraudulent activity. If you do not receive an Order Receipt or an Order cancellation notice, or if the Order Receipt is inaccurate, you must notify your Partner within 24 hours of placing the Order or receiving the Order Receipt. You hereby waive your right to dispute an Order unless you notify the Partner of any objections within 24 hours the applicable Order Receipt was sent to you. We reserve the right, but we have no obligation, to declare an Order null and void that we consider to be erroneous (each, an “Erroneous Order”). You are responsible for ensuring that you submit the appropriate Order type you place an Order to buy or sell Stablecoins, and that a simple assertion by you that you made a mistake in entering an Order, or that you failed to pay attention to or update an Order, will not be sufficient to establish it as an Erroneous Order. If we determine that a given Order is an Erroneous Order, we may declare it null and void, in whole and in part, even if you do not agree to cancel or modify it, in which case you will return the Stablecoins or funds you received in the Erroneous Order. If you place an Erroneous Order and such Erroneous Order is equal to $5 or less, you relinquish your claim to any funds you have sent to us with respect to such Erroneous Order and title to such funds transfers to Bridge upon receipt.<br/>‍<br/>6.6. Downtime. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Bridge Services in a reliable and secure manner. From time to time, interruptions, errors, delays, or other deficiencies in providing the Bridge Services may occur due to downtime of the Partner Services, and a variety of other factors outside our control, and some of which may require or result in scheduled maintenance or unscheduled downtime of the Bridge Services (collectively, “Downtime”). Part or all of the Bridge Services may be unavailable during any Downtime, and we are not liable or responsible to you for any inconvenience or losses you incur as a result of Downtime. <br/>‍<br/>6.7 Compliance with Law. We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel, correct, clawback, or reverse, any purchase, sale or transfer, in our sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; or if we suspect the transaction may: involve money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime; be erroneous or violate the prohibited activities set forth in Exhibit C to this Agreement. In such instances, we will reverse the transaction and we are under no obligation to reinstate a purchase or sale order at the same price or on the same terms as the canceled transaction.</p></div></div><div class="legal-index-content-wrap"><div class="legal-header"><h3><span class="text-color-grey">07</span></h3><h3>General Terms</h3></div><div class="text-size-large w-richtext"><p>7.1. Fees.

We or the Partner will send all notices and communications with you (“Communications”) through your Partner Account to the email address associated with your Partner Account.

We do not provide tax or legal advice. We will report Orders and the proceeds from Orders to the Internal Revenue Service to the extent and manner required by applicable law.<br/>‍<br/>7.4. Intellectual Property; Bridge Materials; Feedback. The text, graphics, images, logos, button icons, photographs, editorial content, notices, software and other materials we provide you, including the manner in which we arrange or present them to you (the “Bridge Materials”) are protected under both the United States and other applicable copyright, trademark, and other laws.

Any distribution, reprint or electronic reproduction of any Bridge Materials in whole or in part for any other purpose is expressly prohibited without our prior written consent.

If you or any Authorized User breaches any of your representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in these terms, give us inaccurate or incomplete information for any reason, or otherwise fail to comply with any other requirements of these terms or any of our policies, we will have the right to suspend or terminate your Bridge Account.

Arbitration; Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver. <br/>‍<br/>7.8.1. This Section 7.8 constitutes your agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) all disputes arising under or in connection with these terms and your relationship with us (collectively, “Claims”). This includes Claims made by us against you, by you or anyone connected to you against us or any of our Affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors, or assignees. Arbitration is often used to resolve Claims more efficiently than a trial, particularly where the amount of the Claim is small. YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A CLAIM IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON ANY CLAIM. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATIONS WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.<br/>‍<br/>7.8.2. Before commencing an action in arbitration, the parties will promptly submit any dispute that they have failed to promptly resolve to mediation before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in New York, New York, or at a location agreed to by the parties, The parties will jointly select the mediator, or if the parties are unable to agree upon a mediator, then the dispute will be submitted to non-binding mediation before the AAA.  If the parties are unable to achieve a mutually agreeable resolution of the dispute through mediation within 60 days after commencement of mediation proceedings, the parties hereby agree to submit their dispute to binding arbitration described below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may file an arbitration demand at any time to comply with any statute of limitation or timing requirements to preserve its Claim.<br/>‍<br/>7.8.3. All Claims will be decided finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) according to this provision and the applicable AAA rules, which may limit the discovery available to you or to us. You can obtain copies of the AAA rule and forms by contacting AAA at 1-800-778-7879 or www.adr.org. Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in the federal judicial district where you reside as of the date you execute these terms. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law of New York and consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (“FAA”) and applicable statutes of limitations and will honor claims of privilege recognized at law.<br/>‍<br/>7.8.4. The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party’s Claims. The arbitrator’s decision and judgment criteria will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect on Claims asserted by any individual or entity who was not party to the arbitration. If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). The arbitration itself will be governed by Federal Arbitration Act 9 USC §1 et. seq.. If a court or arbitrator decides that this Arbitration Agreement cannot be enforced as to a particular Claim for relief, then that Claim (and only that Claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. Individual Claims filed in small claims court are not subject to this Arbitration Agreement as long as the Claim remains in small claims court. The arbitrator alone will have the authority to interpret the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, except that any Claim concerning the scope or enforceability of the prohibition on class, collective, or representative Claims, or Claims in arbitration for public injunctive relief, will be resolved by the state and federal courts in New York, New York in accordance with New York law.<br/>‍<br/>7.8.5.

By accessing and using the Bridge Services, you are promising us that you have read and understand the following Stablecoin Risk Disclosures.</p><p>‍</p><p>1. <em>Unique Features of Stablecoins.</em> Stablecoins are currently not legal tender in many jurisdictions including, without limitation, the United States, the United Kingdom and Poland.</p><p>‍</p><p>2. <em>Stability, Valuation, and Liquidity</em>. The price of Stablecoins is based on the reputation of the Issuer, the financial institution and the jurisdiction where the Issuer stores the Fiat Currency associated with the Stablecoin, the stability of the Blockchain on which the Stablecoins are issued, the laws that apply to Stablecoins and many other factors. Some Stablecoins may lose all of their value, or you may be unable to redeem Stablecoins for Fiat Currency as a result of one or a combination of these factors.</p><p>‍</p><p>3. <em>Cybersecurity</em>. The cybersecurity risks of Stablecoins and related Cryptocurrency Wallets include hacking vulnerabilities and a risk that Blockchains may not be immutable. A cybersecurity event could result in a substantial, immediate and irreversible loss of your Stablecoins. Even a minor cybersecurity event in a Stablecoin is likely to result in a loss of value or ability to redeem a Stablecoin. </p><p>‍</p><p>4. <em>Stablecoin Issuers, Intermediaries and Custodians</em>. Regulation of Stablecoins is constantly evolving. A lack of regulatory oversight creates a risk that an Issuer may not hold enough Fiat Currency to satisfy its obligations to redeem Stablecoins, and that such deficiency may not be easily identified or discovered. In addition, many Issuers and their service providers have experienced significant outages, downtime and processing delays, and may have a higher level of operational risk than traditional financial institutions.</p><p>‍</p><p>5. <em>Regulatory Landscape</em>. Stablecoins currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape. In the United States, Stablecoins are subject to limited federal oversight, and state regulations that apply to Stablecoins vary from state to state and may be inconsistently applied. In addition, Stablecoins may be regulated by additional federal regulators in the future. Such laws and regulations may impact the price of Stablecoins and their acceptance by users, merchants and service providers.</p><p>‍</p><p>6. <em>Technology</em>. The relatively new and rapidly evolving technology underlying Stablecoins introduces unique risks. For example, a unique private key is required to access, use or transfer a Stablecoin on a Blockchain. The loss, theft or destruction of a private key may result in an irreversible loss.</p><p><strong><br/><br/>Exhibit B<br/><br/>Prohibited Activities</strong><br/><br/>You will not use the Bridge Services to undertake or enable by you or any third party (the “<em>Prohibited Activities List</em>”): unlawful or abusive activity, fraud, unlawful gambling, intellectual property infringement, investment or credit services, check cashing, bail bonds, collections agencies, counterfeit or unauthorized goods, drugs and drug paraphernalia (including pseudo pharmaceuticals), substances designed to mimic illegal drugs, adult content and services, multi-level marketing, unfair, predatory or deceptive practices, money services, money transmission, digital asset exchange on behalf of third parties, and any business that Bridge believes poses elevated financial risk, legal liability, or violate card network rules or bank policies.

Instead of offering the Bridge Services directly to the public, we do business through companies who want to offer their customers the ability to buy and sell Stablecoins through their website or mobile application (“<em>Partners</em>”). To do so, our Partners integrate their services (the “<em>Partner Services</em>”) with the Bridge Services and brand the Bridge Services with their name and logo. This means you need to have a valid account with a Partner (a “<em>Partner Account</em>”) if you want to open a Bridge Account. </p><p>‍</p><p>1.2. To be eligible to apply for and use a Bridge Account, you must: (a) be at least 18 years old, (b) have the legal capacity to agree to these terms; and (c) have an active Partner Account. If you are opening a Bridge Account for a Business User, you promise us that: (i) you are authorized by the Business User to open a Bridge Account, (ii) you are an executive officer of the Business User; or (iii) your position permits you to make important decisions for the Business User. If you are a Business User, you may only use the Bridge Services for commercial purposes. If you are not a Business User, you may only use the Bridge Services for personal, consumer, or household purposes.</p><p>‍</p><p>1.3. We cannot provide a Bridge Account to you if you live in or do business in a U.S. state or country where we or our Financial Partners do not provide the Bridge Services (“Restricted Locations”). We can add or remove Restricted Locations from the list at any time without notifying you. We also comply with all U.S. sanctions laws, so we are unable to provide the Bridges Services to you if you live in a country, or you are on a list of persons banned by the U.S. government from doing business with person or companies in the United States.</p><p>‍</p><p>1.4. We need certain Personal Data from you to verify your identity, to process your Bridge Account application, and to provide the Bridge Services to you. Your Partner may share your Personal Data with us with your permission, or we may collect it from you directly. Personal Data may include your name, email address, residential address, phone number, date of birth, and taxpayer identification number, copies of your passport, driver’s license, military identification card or other government-issued photo identification; bank account statements; cryptocurrency wallet addresses you control, the purpose of your use of the Bridge Services, the source of funds you use to buy or sell Stablecoins, and related information we request. We may keep records of your Personal Data if required by a Financial Partners or by applicable law. The Personal Data you provide must always be accurate, complete and up to date. </p><p>‍</p><p>1.5. You will only be able to access your Bridge Account using the username and password associated with your Partner Account (your “<em>Login Credentials</em>”). We are not responsible (and you will not hold us responsible) for any unauthorized access to or use of your Login Credentials, your Partner Account, or your Bridge Account.

We will treat any unauthorized access or activity as potentially fraudulent, and you must notify the Partner within 24 hours if you become aware of or suspect potentially fraudulent activity. When you notify the Partner of potentially fraudulent activity, we and the Partner will temporarily restrict access to your Bridge Account, suspend any pending Orders or withdrawals, require you to change your Login Credentials, and any other reasonable steps to protect your Bridge Account. You must also (a) promptly report any potentially fraudulent activity to legal authorities; (b) provide the Partner with a copy of any report prepared by such legal authorities; (c) cooperate fully with the legal authorities, Partner and Bridge in the investigation; (d) complete any required affidavits promptly, accurately and thoroughly; and (e) allow Bridge, the Partner, or any third party designated by us access to your mobile device, computer, and network if relevant to the investigation.</p></div></div><div id="w-node-_3da04ab4-2ee4-b910-4b62-40624009f8a4-33c4f627" class="legal-index-content-wrap"><div class="legal-header"><h3><span class="text-color-grey">02</span></h3><h3>Connected Accounts and Wallets</h3></div><div class="text-size-large w-richtext"><p>2.1.

To process Orders, you must provide at least one bank account to fund purchase Orders and to receive the proceeds of sale Orders (your “<em>Connected Account</em>”), and/or at least one cryptocurrency wallet address (your “<em>Cryptocurrency Wallet</em>”) to receive the Stablecoins you purchase, as applicable. Your Connected Account and/or  your Cryptocurrency Wallet must be under your sole ownership or control, and we have the right to suspend Orders if we suspect that you do not own or control your Connected Account or your Cryptocurrency Wallet. We may ask you for information about the financial institution or other provider of your Cryptocurrency Wallet and your Connected Account. If your Cryptocurrency Wallet is not provided to you by a regulated financial institution (a “<em>Self-Directed Wallet</em>”), we may ask you for more information about the Self-Directed Wallet and your Orders may be delayed or even blocked. We reserve the right to cancel or reverse purchase Orders if you use a Self-Directed Wallet or if our Financial Partners require us to do so. You authorize us to share Personal Data and Order information with our Financial Partners and with the financial institution providers of your Connected Account and/or Cryptocurrency Wallet.</p><p>‍</p><p>2.2.

The computer networks used to exchange Digital Assets are called “Blockchains”. We may also permit you to buy Stablecoins that are compatible with one or more cryptographic protocols. A list of Digital Assets and Stablecoins we support are available via your Partner Account. We do not support the purchase of any Digital Assets that are not Stablecoins. We may remove a Digital Asset or Stablecoin due to changes in the characteristics or regulatory classification of the asset, or for any other reason at any time. If we delist a Stablecoin while an Order is in process, we will reverse your Order and return the funds you used to pay for the Order to your Connected Account or to your Cryptocurrency Wallet, as applicable.

We do not operate, own, or control any Blockchains. By their nature, Blockchains use open-source software that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute. Neither we nor our Financial Partners or your Partner are responsible for the operation of any Blockchains that are compatible with the Stablecoins and Digital Assets we support, and we do not guarantee the functionality, security, or availability of any Blockchains. Some of the financial institutions that issue Stablecoins on various Blockchains (“Issuers”) include software code that they can use to block the transfer of Stablecoins if the Issuer suspects illegal activity or pursuant to a request from law enforcement. We have no control over the software code of any of the Stablecoins we support, and you are purchasing Stablecoins at your own risk.</p><p>‍</p><p>5.2. Blockchains are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, and third parties may from time to time create a copy of a Blockchain and implement changes in operating rules or other features (“<em>Forks</em>”) that may result in more than one version of a Blockchain (each, a “<em>Forked Blockchain</em>”) and more than one version of a Stablecoin (“<em>Forked Stablecoins</em>”) or Digital Asset (“<em>Forked Asset</em>”). Our ability to support Forked Stablecoins or accept Forked Assets resulting from a Forked Network is completely outside our control. Forks may materially affect the value and function of the Stablecoins you purchase from or sell to us and depends entirely on the Issuer of the Forked Stablecoin. In the event of a Fork, we may temporarily suspend any Orders in process at the time of the Fork with or without notice to you while we determine the effects of the Fork on the functionality of the Bridge Services. Issuers will almost certainly not support Forked versions of the Stablecoins they issue, and you may not be permitted to redeem Forked Stablecoins for Fiat Currency. Attempts to Fork a Blockchain may also result in complete or partial failure of the Blockchain’s functionality, and the Stablecoins and Digital Assets you own that are supported by the Blockchain may become worthless.</p><p>‍</p><p>WE MAY CHOOSE NOT TO SUPPORT FORKED BLOCKCHAINS, AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT, CLAIM, OR OTHER PRIVILEGE TO FORKED STABLECOINS ON A FORKED NETWORK WE DO NOT SUPPORT, EVEN IN THE RARE EVENT AN ISSUER SUPPORTS THE FORK.

You can only place Orders through your Partner Account using your Login Credentials. If we receive an Order from you, we will assume you intended for us to execute the Order. All purchase Orders require full payment in cleared funds at the time we fill your Order. Do not place an Order to purchase Stablecoins with Fiat Currency if you don’t have enough funds in your Connected Account. We will not process Orders to purchase Stablecoins with Digital Assets or other Stablecoins before we or our Financial Partners receive the Digital Assets or Stablecoins from you. We do not guarantee that we will fill your Order, and we reserve the right to cancel any Order or part of an Order for any reason, including if the Order: (a) was placed during a scheduled or unscheduled downtime of Bridge or Company; (v) violates these terms or a Financial Partner Agreement; or (c) is non-marketable.</p><p>‍</p><p>6.2.<strong> </strong><em>Source of Funds; Destination of Proceeds; Order Limits</em>. We only authorize Orders using funds in a Connected Account or Cryptocurrency Wallet you control. You are not allowed to use funds that do not belong to you to place Orders, and that you cannot place Orders on behalf of a third party. Each time you place an Order, you are promising that all you own the funds used by you to execute an Order, and that the funds are not the direct or indirect proceeds of any criminal or fraudulent activity. When we receive funds (Fiat Currency or Stablecoins) for your Order, title to those funds transfers to Bridge upon receipt. When we send to you proceeds (Fiat Currency or Stablecoins) from your Order, title to those funds transfer to you upon your receipt of those funds. Any proceeds from the sale of Stablecoins will be Connected Account or to your Cryptocurrency Wallet, and that you will not have the option to transfer proceeds to any other bank account, including a bank account that you own. Neither Bridge nor Company will hold any sale proceeds on your behalf. We may limit the amount and frequency of your Orders (in USD terms) in a given time period. These limits may depend on when you opened your Bridge Account, the Personal Data you provided us, and a variety of other risk factors.</p><p>‍</p><p>6.3. <em>Order Receipts and Order History.</em> When we fill your Order, the Partner will send you a confirmation (the “<em>Order Receipt</em>”) on our behalf through your Partner Account or to the email address associated with your Partner Account or we will send one directly to that email address. We may choose without prior notice to you, to periodically consolidate multiple Orders into a single Order Receipt. You may request your Order history by emailing support@bridge.xyz. We maintain records of all Orders for a period of seven years or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p><p>‍</p><p>6.4. <em>Right to Offset</em>. If you fail to provide sufficient funds at the time we fill your Order, we reserve the right to cancel, reverse or fill the Order in whole or in part. You agree to be responsible for the costs of any such action we take, including gas and exchange fees. You will also be responsible for such costs if you cancel your transaction prior to processing and we return funds to you. If your failure to provide sufficient funds or a return results in an amount due and owing by you to us (a “<em>Negative Balance</em>”), we have the right to: (a) charge a reasonable rate of interest on the Negative Balance; (b) offset any Negative Balance and any accrued interest and other losses by debiting funds from your Connected Account in the amount of the Negative Balance; and (c) offset any Negative Balance against amounts we owe you for Stablecoins we purchase from you, Stablecoins you have purchased from us, or funds you have requested to be returned.</p><p>‍</p><p>6.5. <em>Cancellations; Errors. </em>You may not cancel an Order after we have commenced processing it. If you cancel your Order and you have not provided sufficient information in order for us to return your funds, we will hold your funds as required by law. You are solely responsible for reviewing your Order Receipts for accuracy and for monitoring your Order History for any errors or any potentially fraudulent activity. If you do not receive an Order Receipt or an Order cancellation notice, or if the Order Receipt is inaccurate, you must notify your Partner within 24 hours of placing the Order or receiving the Order Receipt. You hereby waive your right to dispute an Order unless you notify the Partner of any objections within 24 hours the applicable Order Receipt was sent to you. We reserve the right, but we have no obligation, to declare an Order null and void that we consider to be erroneous (each, an “<em>Erroneous Order</em>”). You are responsible for ensuring that you submit the appropriate Order type you place an Order to buy or sell Stablecoins, and that a simple assertion by you that you made a mistake in entering an Order, or that you failed to pay attention to or update an Order, will not be sufficient to establish it as an Erroneous Order. If we determine that a given Order is an Erroneous Order, we may declare it null and void, in whole and in part, even if you do not agree to cancel or modify it, in which case you will return the Stablecoins or funds you received in the Erroneous Order. If you place an Erroneous Order and such Erroneous Order is equal to $5 or less, you relinquish your claim to any funds you have sent to us with respect to such Erroneous Order and title to such funds transfers to Bridge upon receipt.</p><p>‍</p><p>6.6. <em>Downtime. </em>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Bridge Services in a reliable and secure manner. From time to time, interruptions, errors, delays, or other deficiencies in providing the Bridge Services may occur due to downtime of the Partner Services, and a variety of other factors outside our control, and some of which may require or result in scheduled maintenance or unscheduled downtime of the Bridge Services (collectively, “<em>Downtime</em>”). Part or all of the Bridge Services may be unavailable during any Downtime, and we are not liable or responsible to you for any inconvenience or losses you incur as a result of Downtime.</p><p>‍</p><p>6.7 <em>Compliance with Law. </em>We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel, correct, clawback, or reverse, any purchase, sale or transfer, in our sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; or if we suspect the transaction may: involve money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime; be erroneous or violate the prohibited activities set forth in <strong>Exhibit C</strong> to this Agreement. In such instances, we will reverse the transaction and we are under no obligation to reinstate a purchase or sale order at the same price or on the same terms as the canceled transaction.</p></div></div><div id="w-node-_90bcd264-c6d3-9a4e-268c-eb8a0c08a3a6-33c4f627" class="legal-index-content-wrap"><div class="legal-header"><h3><span class="text-color-grey">07</span></h3><h3>General Terms</h3></div><div class="text-size-large w-richtext"><p>7.1. <em>Fees</em>.

This Section 7.8 constitutes your agreement to arbitrate (“<em>Arbitration Agreement</em>”) all disputes arising under or in connection with these terms and your relationship with us (collectively, “<em>Claims</em>”). This includes Claims made by us against you, by you or anyone connected to you against us or any of our Affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors, or assignees. Arbitration is often used to resolve Claims more efficiently than a trial, particularly where the amount of the Claim is small. YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A CLAIM IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON ANY CLAIM. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATIONS WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.8.2. Before commencing an action in arbitration, the parties will promptly submit any dispute that they have failed to promptly resolve to mediation before the American Arbitration Association (“<em>AAA</em>”) in New York, New York, or at a location agreed to by the parties, The parties will jointly select the mediator, or if the parties are unable to agree upon a mediator, then the dispute will be submitted to non-binding mediation before the AAA. If the parties are unable to achieve a mutually agreeable resolution of the dispute through mediation within 60 days after commencement of mediation proceedings, the parties hereby agree to submit their dispute to binding arbitration described below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may file an arbitration demand at any time to comply with any statute of limitation or timing requirements to preserve its Claim.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.8.3. All Claims will be decided finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<em>AAA</em>”) according to this provision and the applicable AAA rules, which may limit the discovery available to you or to us. You can obtain copies of the AAA rule and forms by contacting AAA at 1-800-778-7879 or www.adr.org. Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in the federal judicial district where you reside as of the date you execute these terms. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law of New York and consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (“<em>FAA</em>”) and applicable statutes of limitations and will honor claims of privilege recognized at law.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.8.4. The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party’s Claims. The arbitrator’s decision and judgment criteria will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect on Claims asserted by any individual or entity who was not party to the arbitration. If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). The arbitration itself will be governed by Federal Arbitration Act 9 USC §1 et. seq.. If a court or arbitrator decides that this Arbitration Agreement cannot be enforced as to a particular Claim for relief, then that Claim (and only that Claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. Individual Claims filed in small claims court are not subject to this Arbitration Agreement as long as the Claim remains in small claims court. The arbitrator alone will have the authority to interpret the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, except that any Claim concerning the scope or enforceability of the prohibition on class, collective, or representative Claims, or Claims in arbitration for public injunctive relief, will be resolved by the state and federal courts in New York, New York in accordance with New York law.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.8.5. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ARBITRATE ALL CLAIMS AS PROVIDED IN THIS USER AGREEMENT, THEN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT SUCH ARBITRATION PROVISIONS BY DELIVERING A WRITTEN NOTICE TO US AT ADMIN@BRIDGE.XYZ, ATTENTION: LEGAL DEPARTMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU REGISTERED FOR YOUR BRIDGE ACCOUNT. YOUR REJECTION OF ANY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS DOES NOT AFFECT ANY INDEPENDENT ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, AND YOU REMAIN SUBJECT TO ANY ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION OR JURY TRIAL WAIVER OR DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSES SET OUT IN THOSE SEPARATE AGREEMENTS. YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME, YOUR MAILING ADDRESS, YOUR EMAIL, AND YOUR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER IN THE NOTICE.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.9. <em>Governing Law and Venue. </em>These terms and your access to and use of the Bridge Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the state of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties arising out or relating to these terms that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of the state of New York and the United States, respectively.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.10. <em>Regulation. </em>Bridge is registered with the U.S. Department of Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“<em>FinCEN</em>”) as a money services business (“<em>MSB</em>”).

You understand that compliance with Applicable Laws may include compliance with any guidance or direction of any regulatory authority or government agency, any writ of attachment, lien, levy, subpoena, warrant, or other legal order (collectively, “<em>Legal Orders</em>”). In no event will we be obligated to affect any Order that we believe would violate any Applicable Law. We are not responsible for any losses, whether direct or indirect, that you may incur as a result of our good faith efforts to comply with any Applicable Law, including any Legal Order. </p><p>‍</p><p>7.12. <em>Force Majeure. </em>We are not be liable for delays, failure in performance or interruption of service that result directly or indirectly from significant market volatility, acts of God, acts of civil or military authorities, acts of terrorists, civil disturbance, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or Internet services or network provider services, failures of equipment or software, pandemics, other catastrophe or any other occurrence that is beyond our reasonable control.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.13.<em> Survival. </em>All provisions pertaining to suspension, termination, or cancellation of the Bridge Services, debts owed to Bridge, disputes with Bridge and general provisions, and all other provisions of these terms which by their nature extend beyond the expiration or termination of these terms survive the termination or expiration of these terms.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.14. <em>Entire Agreement. </em>These terms, our Privacy Policy, and all other terms incorporated into these terms comprise the entire understanding and agreement between you and Bridge as to the subject matter of these terms, and supersede any and all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of these terms), between you and Bridge.

If Bridge is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the Personal Data we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. You may not assign any rights or licenses granted under these terms. Any attempted transfer or assignment by you in violation of this Section 7.15 will be null and void.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.16. <em>Severability. </em>If any provision of these terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any local, state, or federal government agency, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these terms will not be affected.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.17. <em>Non-Waiver of Rights. </em>These terms may not be construed to waive rights that cannot be waived under Applicable Law, including applicable state money transmission laws in the state where you are located. In addition, our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these terms or to exercise any right under these terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of our right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.18. <em>Modifications to these Terms. </em>We reserve the right to make changes to these terms and to the Bridge Services at any time. If we make changes, our Partner will post the amended terms in your Partner Account. We may also notify you by sending an email to the address on file in your Partner Account.

By accessing and using the Bridge Services, you are promising us that you have read and understand the following Stablecoin Risk Disclosures.</p><p>‍</p><p>1. <strong>Unique Features of Stablecoins</strong>.  Stablecoins are not legal tender in the United States.</p><p>‍</p><p>2. <strong>Stability, Valuation, and Liquidity</strong>. The price of Stablecoins is based on the reputation of the Issuer, the financial institution and the jurisdiction where the Issuer stores the Fiat Currency associated with the Stablecoin, the stability of the Blockchain on which the Stablecoins are issued, the laws that apply to Stablecoins and many other factors. Some Stablecoins may lose all of their value, or you may be unable to redeem Stablecoins for Fiat Currency as a result of one or a combination of these factors. </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>3. Cybersecurity. </strong>The cybersecurity risks of Stablecoins and related Cryptocurrency Wallets include hacking vulnerabilities and a risk that Blockchains may not be immutable. A cybersecurity event could result in a substantial, immediate and irreversible loss of your Stablecoins. Even a minor cybersecurity event in a Stablecoin is likely to result in a loss of value or ability to redeem a Stablecoin.  </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>4. Stablecoin Issuers, Intermediaries and Custodians. </strong>Regulation of Stablecoins is constantly evolving. A lack of regulatory oversight creates a risk that an Issuer may not hold enough Fiat Currency to satisfy its obligations to redeem Stablecoins, and that such deficiency may not be easily identified or discovered. In addition, many Issuers and their service providers have experienced significant outages, downtime and processing delays, and may have a higher level of operational risk than traditional financial institutions. </p><p> </p><p><strong>5. Regulatory Landscape. </strong>Stablecoins currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape. In the United States, Stablecoins are subject to limited federal oversight, and state regulations that apply to Stablecoins vary from state to state and may be inconsistently applied. In addition, Stablecoins may be regulated by additional federal regulators in the future. Such laws and regulations may impact the price of Stablecoins and their acceptance by users, merchants and service providers. </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>6.

Instead of offering the Bridge Services directly to the public, we do business through companies who want to offer their customers the ability to buy and sell Stablecoins through their website or mobile application (“<em>Partners</em>”). To do so, our Partners integrate their services (the “<em>Partner Services</em>”) with the Bridge Services and brand the Bridge Services with their name and logo. This means you need to have a valid account with a Partner (a “<em>Partner Account</em>”) if you want to open a Bridge Account.</p><p>‍</p><p>1.2. To be eligible to apply for and use a Bridge Account, you must: (a) be at least 18 years old, (b) have the legal capacity to agree to these terms; and (c) have an active Partner Account. If you are opening a Bridge Account for a Business User, you promise us that: (i) you are authorized by the Business User to open a Bridge Account, (ii) you are an executive officer of the Business User; or (iii) your position permits you to make important decisions for the Business User. If you are a Business User, you may only use the Bridge Services for commercial purposes. If you are not a Business User, you may only use the Bridge Services for personal, consumer, or household purposes.</p><p>‍</p><p>1.3. We cannot provide a Bridge Account to you if you live in or do business in a country where we do not provide the Bridge Services (“<em>Restricted Locations</em>”). We can add or remove Restricted Locations from the list at any time without notifying you. We also comply with all US, EU and similar sanctions laws, so we are unable to provide the Bridges Services to you if you live in a country, or you are on a list of persons banned by these governments from doing business with persons or companies in such jurisdictions.</p><p>‍</p><p>1.4. We need certain Personal Data from you to verify your identity, to process your Bridge Account application, and to provide the Bridge Services to you. Your Partner may share your Personal Data with us with your permission, or we may collect it from you directly. Personal Data may include your name, email address, residential address, phone number, date of birth, and taxpayer identification number, copies of your passport, driver’s license, military identification card or other government-issued photo identification; bank account statements; Receiving Wallet addresses you control, the purpose of your use of the Bridge Services, the source of funds you use to buy or sell Stablecoins, and related information we request. We may keep records of your Personal Data if required by applicable law. The Personal Data you provide must always be accurate, complete and up to date.</p><p>‍</p><p>1.5. You will only be able to access your Bridge Account using the username and password associated with your Partner Account (your “<em>Login Credentials</em>”). We are not responsible (and you will not hold us responsible) for any unauthorized access to or use of your Login Credentials, your Partner Account, or your Bridge Account. We do not have access to your Partner Account, and we cannot retrieve or change your Login Credentials. Contact the Partner immediately if you become aware of or suspect any unauthorized access to your Partner Account.</p><p>‍</p><p>1.6 WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR ACTIVITY TO YOUR BRIDGE ACCOUNT. We will treat any unauthorized access or activity as potentially fraudulent, and you must notify the Partner within 24 hours if you become aware of or suspect potentially fraudulent activity. When you notify the Partner of potentially fraudulent activity, we and the Partner will temporarily restrict access to your Bridge Account, suspend any pending Orders or withdrawals, require you to change your Login Credentials, and any other reasonable steps to protect your Bridge Account. You must also (a) promptly report any potentially fraudulent activity to legal authorities; (b) provide the Partner with a copy of any report prepared by such legal authorities; (c) cooperate fully with the legal authorities, Partner and Bridge in the investigation; (d) complete any required affidavits promptly, accurately and thoroughly; and (e) allow Bridge, the Partner, or any third party designated by us access to your mobile device, computer, and network if relevant to the investigation.</p></div></div><div id="w-node-eecae143-84d9-6ec3-80e7-40cc90857750-33c4f627" class="legal-index-content-wrap"><div class="legal-header"><h3><span class="text-color-grey">02</span></h3><h3>Funding Wallets and Wallets</h3></div><div class="text-size-large w-richtext"><p>2.1.

Your Funding Wallet and/or your Receiving Wallet must be under your sole ownership or control, and we have the right to suspend Orders if we suspect that you do not own or control your Funding Wallet or your Receiving Wallet. We may ask you for information about the financial institution or other provider of your Receiving Wallet and your Funding Wallet. If your Funding Wallet or Receiving Wallet is not provided to you by a regulated financial institution (a “<em>Self-Directed Wallet</em>”), we may ask you for more information about the Self-Directed Wallet and your Orders may be delayed or even blocked. We reserve the right to cancel or reverse purchase Orders if you use a Self-Directed Wallet. You authorize us to share Personal Data and Order information with the financial institution providers of your Funding Wallet and/or Receiving Wallet.</p><p>‍</p><p>2.2.

You are solely responsible for monitoring your Funding Wallet and Receiving Wallet for unauthorized or suspicious activity, and we are not liable to you if you lose your funds due to unauthorized activity. To protect your Funding Wallet and Receiving Wallet from unauthorized activity, you must: (a) review your Order history on an ongoing basis; (b) immediately review Order receipts, confirmations and notices we send you through your Partner Account or to the email address associated with your Partner Account; and (c) verify you received an Order confirmation, and (d) notify the Partner within 24 hours of the Order if you do not receive an Order confirmation.</p></div></div><div id="w-node-cd388956-e948-059c-4db6-7c188ae48794-33c4f627" class="legal-index-content-wrap"><div class="legal-header"><h3><span class="text-color-grey">03</span></h3><h3>Bridge Account Suspension and Termination</h3></div><div class="text-size-large w-richtext"><p>3.1.

The computer networks used to exchange Digital Assets are called “Blockchains”. We may also permit you to buy Stablecoins that are compatible with one or more cryptographic protocols. A list of Digital Assets and Stablecoins we support are available via your Partner Account. We do not support the purchase of any Digital Assets that are not Stablecoins. We may remove a Digital Asset or Stablecoin due to changes in the characteristics or regulatory classification of the asset, or for any other reason at any time. If we delist a Stablecoin while an Order is in process, we will reverse your Order and return the funds you used to pay for the Order to your Funding Wallet or to your Receiving Wallet, as applicable. If you send funds to Bridge that are not supported, these funds will be lost.

We do not operate, own, or control any Blockchains. By their nature, Blockchains use open-source software that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute. Neither we nor your Partner are responsible for the operation of any Blockchains that are compatible with the Stablecoins and Digital Assets we support, and we do not guarantee the functionality, security, or availability of any Blockchains. Some of the financial institutions that issue Stablecoins on various Blockchains (“<em>Issuers</em>”) include software code that they can use to block the transfer of Stablecoins if the Issuer suspects illegal activity or pursuant to a request from law enforcement. We have no control over the software code of any of the Stablecoins we support, and you are purchasing Stablecoins at your own risk.</p><p>‍</p><p>5.2. Blockchains are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, and third parties may from time to time create a copy of a Blockchain and implement changes in operating rules or other features (“<em>Forks</em>”) that may result in more than one version of a Blockchain (each, a “<em>Forked Blockchain</em>”) and more than one version of a Stablecoin (“<em>Forked Stablecoins</em>”) or Digital Asset (“<em>Forked Asset</em>”). Our ability to support Forked Stablecoins or accept Forked Assets resulting from a Forked Network is completely outside our control. Forks may materially affect the value and function of the Stablecoins you purchase from or sell to us and depends entirely on the Issuer of the Forked Stablecoin. In the event of a Fork, we may temporarily suspend any Orders in process at the time of the Fork with or without notice to you while we determine the effects of the Fork on the functionality of the Bridge Services. Issuers will almost certainly not support Forked versions of the Stablecoins they issue, and you may not be permitted to redeem Forked Stablecoins for another Stablecoin or other Digital Asset. Attempts to Fork a Blockchain may also result in complete or partial failure of the Blockchain’s functionality, and the Stablecoins and Digital Assets you own that are supported by the Blockchain may become worthless.</p><p>‍</p><p>WE MAY CHOOSE NOT TO SUPPORT FORKED BLOCKCHAINS, AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT, CLAIM, OR OTHER PRIVILEGE TO FORKED STABLECOINS ON A FORKED NETWORK WE DO NOT SUPPORT, EVEN IN THE RARE EVENT AN ISSUER SUPPORTS THE FORK.

THERE ARE MANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BUYING AND SELLING STABLECOINS. WE HAVE DESCRIBED THESE RISKS IN OUR STABLECOIN RISK DISCLOSURE AVAILABLE IN EXHIBIT B TO THIS AGREEMENT.

If we receive an Order from you, we will assume you intended for us to execute the Order. All purchase Orders require full payment in cleared funds at the time we fill your Order. Do not place an Order to purchase Stablecoins with other Stablecoins if you don’t have enough funds in your Funding Wallet. We will not process Orders to purchase Stablecoins with Digital Assets or other Stablecoins before we receive the Digital Assets or Stablecoins from you.  We do not guarantee that we will fill your Order, and we reserve the right to cancel any Order or part of an Order for any reason, including if the Order: (a) was placed during a scheduled or unscheduled downtime of Bridge or Company; (v) violates these terms; or (c) is non-marketable.</p><p>‍</p><p>6.2. <em>Source of Funds; Destination of Proceeds; Order Limits.</em> We only authorize Orders using funds in a Funding Wallet or Receiving Wallet you control. You are not allowed to use funds that do not belong to you to place Orders, and that you cannot place Orders on behalf of a third party. Each time you place an Order, you are promising that all you own the funds used by you to execute an Order, and that the funds are not the direct or indirect proceeds of any criminal or fraudulent activity. When we receive funds for your Order, title to those funds transfers to Bridge upon receipt. When we send to you proceeds from your Order, title to those funds transfer to you upon your receipt of those funds. Any proceeds from the sale of Stablecoins will be Funding Wallet or to your Receiving Wallet, and that you will not have the option to transfer proceeds to any other bank account, including a bank account that you own. Neither Bridge nor Company will hold any sale proceeds on your behalf. We may limit the amount and frequency of your Orders (in USD terms) in a given time period. These limits may depend on when you opened your Bridge Account, the Personal Data you provided us, and a variety of other risk factors.</p><p>‍</p><p>6.3.  <em>Order Receipts and Order History.</em> When we fill your Order, the Partner will send you a confirmation (the “Order Receipt”) on our behalf through your Partner Account or to the email address associated with your Partner Account or we will send one directly to that email address. We may choose without prior notice to you, to periodically consolidate multiple Orders into a single Order Receipt. You may request your Order history by emailing support@bridge.xyz. We maintain records of all Orders for a period of seven years or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p><p>‍</p><p>6.4. <em>Right to Offset.</em> If you fail to provide sufficient funds at the time we fill your Order, we reserve the right to cancel, reverse or fill the Order in whole or in part. You agree to be responsible for the costs of any such action we take, including gas and exchange fees. You will also be responsible for such costs if you cancel your transaction prior to processing and we return funds to you. If your failure to provide sufficient funds or a return results in an amount due and owing by you to us (a “Negative Balance”), we have the right to: (a) charge a reasonable rate of interest on the Negative Balance; (b) offset any Negative Balance and any accrued interest and other losses by debiting funds from your Funding Wallet in the amount of the Negative Balance; and (c) offset any Negative Balance against amounts we owe you for Stablecoins we purchase from you, Stablecoins you have purchased from us, or funds you have requested to be returned.</p><p>‍</p><p>6.5. <em>Cancellations; Errors. You may not cancel an Order after we have commenced processing it.</em> If you cancel your Order and you have not provided sufficient information in order for us to return your funds, we will hold your funds as required by law. You are solely responsible for reviewing your Order Receipts for accuracy and for monitoring your Order History for any errors or any potentially fraudulent activity. If you do not receive an Order Receipt or an Order cancellation notice, or if the Order Receipt is inaccurate, you must notify your Partner within 24 hours of placing the Order or receiving the Order Receipt. You hereby waive your right to dispute an Order unless you notify the Partner of any objections within 24 hours the applicable Order Receipt was sent to you. We reserve the right, but we have no obligation, to declare an Order null and void that we consider to be erroneous (each, an “Erroneous Order”). You are responsible for ensuring that you submit the appropriate Order type you place an Order to buy or sell Stablecoins, and that a simple assertion by you that you made a mistake in entering an Order, or that you failed to pay attention to or update an Order, will not be sufficient to establish it as an Erroneous Order. If we determine that a given Order is an Erroneous Order, we may declare it null and void, in whole and in part, even if you do not agree to cancel or modify it, in which case you will return the Stablecoins or funds you received in the Erroneous Order. If you place an Erroneous Order and such Erroneous Order is equal to $5 or less, you relinquish your claim to any funds you have sent to us with respect to such Erroneous Order and title to such funds transfers to Bridge upon receipt.</p><p>‍</p><p>6.6. <em>Downtime.</em> We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Bridge Services in a reliable and secure manner. From time to time, interruptions, errors, delays, or other deficiencies in providing the Bridge Services may occur due to downtime of the Partner Services, and a variety of other factors outside our control, and some of which may require or result in scheduled maintenance or unscheduled downtime of the Bridge Services (collectively, “Downtime”). Part or all of the Bridge Services may be unavailable during any Downtime, and we are not liable or responsible to you for any inconvenience or losses you incur as a result of Downtime. </p><p>‍</p><p>6.7 <em>Compliance with Law.</em> We reserve the right to refuse to process, or to cancel, correct, clawback, or reverse, any purchase, sale or transfer, in our sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; or if we suspect the transaction may: involve money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime; be erroneous or violate the prohibited activities set forth in Exhibit C to this Agreement. In such instances, we will reverse the transaction and we are under no obligation to reinstate a purchase or sale order at the same price or on the same terms as the canceled transaction.</p></div></div><div id="w-node-_42b7ecf9-719f-8837-267d-11624310f005-33c4f627" class="legal-index-content-wrap"><div class="legal-header"><h3><span class="text-color-grey">07</span></h3><h3>General Terms</h3></div><div class="text-size-large w-richtext"><p>7.1. <em>Fees</em>.

Further, none of Bridge, or our Affiliates, nor any of their respective officers, directors, managers, partners, employees or independent agents or contractors will be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, consequential or exemplary damages or any other losses that are not direct damages, which includes trading losses, lost profits and other lost business opportunities relating to sending Orders to Bridge, directing the transfer of funds to Bridge, storing Stablecoins in a Receiving Wallet and your use of the Bridge Services.</p><p>‍</p><p>IF YOU ARE A NEW JERSEY RESIDENT, the provisions of this Section 7.7 are intended to apply only to the extent permitted under New Jersey law.</p><p>‍</p><p>The no warranty provisions and limitation of liability set forth in this Section 7.7 are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Bridge and you.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>7.8. Arbitration; Jury Trial and Class Action Waiver.</em><strong> </strong></p><p>‍</p><p>7.8.1. This Section 7.8 constitutes your agreement to arbitrate (“<em>Arbitration Agreement</em>”) all disputes arising under or in connection with these terms and your relationship with us (collectively, “<em>Claims</em>”). This includes Claims made by us against you, by you or anyone connected to you against us or any of our Affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors, or assignees. Arbitration is often used to resolve Claims more efficiently than a trial, particularly where the amount of the Claim is small. YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A CLAIM IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON ANY CLAIM. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATIONS WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.8.2. Before commencing an action in arbitration, the parties will promptly submit any dispute that they have failed to promptly resolve to mediation before the American Arbitration Association (“<em>AAA</em>”) in New York, New York, or at a location agreed to by the parties, The parties will jointly select the mediator, or if the parties are unable to agree upon a mediator, then the dispute will be submitted to non-binding mediation before the AAA.  If the parties are unable to achieve a mutually agreeable resolution of the dispute through mediation within 60 days after commencement of mediation proceedings, the parties hereby agree to submit their dispute to binding arbitration described below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may file an arbitration demand at any time to comply with any statute of limitation or timing requirements to preserve its Claim.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.8.3. All Claims will be decided finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<em>AAA</em>”) according to this provision and the applicable AAA rules, which may limit the discovery available to you or to us. You can obtain copies of the AAA rule and forms by contacting AAA at 1-800-778-7879 or www.adr.org. Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take place in the federal judicial district where you reside as of the date you execute these terms. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law of New York and consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (“<em>FAA</em>”) and applicable statutes of limitations and will honor claims of privilege recognized at law.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.8.4. The arbitrator’s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. While an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party’s Claims. The arbitrator’s decision and judgment criteria will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect on Claims asserted by any individual or entity who was not party to the arbitration. If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration). The arbitration itself will be governed by Federal Arbitration Act 9 USC §1 et. seq.. If a court or arbitrator decides that this Arbitration Agreement cannot be enforced as to a particular Claim for relief, then that Claim (and only that Claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. Individual Claims filed in small claims court are not subject to this Arbitration Agreement as long as the Claim remains in small claims court. The arbitrator alone will have the authority to interpret the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, except that any Claim concerning the scope or enforceability of the prohibition on class, collective, or representative Claims, or Claims in arbitration for public injunctive relief, will be resolved by the state and federal courts in New York, New York in accordance with New York law.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.8.5. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO ARBITRATE ALL CLAIMS AS PROVIDED IN THIS USER AGREEMENT, THEN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT SUCH ARBITRATION PROVISIONS BY DELIVERING A WRITTEN NOTICE TO US AT ADMIN@BRIDGE.XYZ, ATTENTION: LEGAL DEPARTMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU REGISTERED FOR YOUR BRIDGE ACCOUNT. YOUR REJECTION OF ANY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS DOES NOT AFFECT ANY INDEPENDENT ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, AND YOU REMAIN SUBJECT TO ANY ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION OR JURY TRIAL WAIVER OR DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESSES SET OUT IN THOSE SEPARATE AGREEMENTS. YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME, YOUR MAILING ADDRESS, YOUR EMAIL, AND YOUR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER IN THE NOTICE.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.9. <em>Governing Law and Venue</em>. These terms and your access to and use of the Bridge Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the state of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties arising out or relating to these terms that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of the state of New York and the United States, respectively.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.10. <em>Regulation</em>. Bridge is registered with the U.S. Department of Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“<em>FinCEN</em>”) as a money services business (“<em>MSB</em>”).

Compliance with Applicable Laws. Orders are subject to applicable laws, regulations, and rules of federal and state governmental and regulatory authorities (collectively, “Applicable Laws”). You understand that compliance with Applicable Laws may include compliance with any guidance or direction of any regulatory authority or government agency, any writ of attachment, lien, levy, subpoena, warrant, or other legal order (collectively, “Legal Orders”). In no event will we be obligated to affect any Order that we believe would violate any Applicable Law. We are not responsible for any losses, whether direct or indirect, that you may incur as a result of our good faith efforts to comply with any Applicable Law, including any Legal Order. </p><p>‍</p><p>7.12. <em>Force Majeure</em>. We are not be liable for delays, failure in performance or interruption of service that result directly or indirectly from significant market volatility, acts of God, acts of civil or military authorities, acts of terrorists, civil disturbance, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or Internet services or network provider services, failures of equipment or software, pandemics, other catastrophe or any other occurrence that is beyond our reasonable control.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.13. <em>Survival</em>. All provisions pertaining to suspension, termination, or cancellation of the Bridge Services, debts owed to Bridge, disputes with Bridge and general provisions, and all other provisions of these terms which by their nature extend beyond the expiration or termination of these terms survive the termination or expiration of these terms.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.14. <em>Entire Agreement</em>. These terms, our Privacy Policy, and all other terms incorporated into these terms comprise the entire understanding and agreement between you and Bridge as to the subject matter of these terms, and supersede any and all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of these terms), between you and Bridge.

If Bridge is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the Personal Data we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. You may not assign any rights or licenses granted under these terms. Any attempted transfer or assignment by you in violation of this Section 7.15 will be null and void.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.16. <em>Severability</em>. If any provision of these terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any local, state, or federal government agency, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these terms will not be affected.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.17. <em>Non-Waiver of Rights</em>. These terms may not be construed to waive rights that cannot be waived under Applicable Law, including applicable state money transmission laws in the state where you are located. In addition, our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these terms or to exercise any right under these terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of our right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.</p><p>‍</p><p>7.18. <em>Modifications to these Terms</em>. We reserve the right to make changes to these terms and to the Bridge Services at any time. If we make changes, our Partner will post the amended terms in your Partner Account.

By accessing and using the Bridge Services, you are promising us that you have read and understand the following Stablecoin Risk Disclosures.</p><p>‍</p><p>1. <strong>Unique Features of Stablecoins</strong>.  Stablecoins are not legal tender in the United States.</p><p>‍</p><p>2. <strong>Stability, Valuation, and Liquidity</strong>. The price of Stablecoins is based on the reputation of the Issuer, the financial institution and the jurisdiction where the Issuer stores the Fiat Currency associated with the Stablecoin, the stability of the Blockchain on which the Stablecoins are issued, the laws that apply to Stablecoins and many other factors. Some Stablecoins may lose all of their value, or you may be unable to redeem Stablecoins for Fiat Currency as a result of one or a combination of these factors. </p><p>‍</p><p>3. <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>. The cybersecurity risks of Stablecoins and related Receiving Wallets include hacking vulnerabilities and a risk that Blockchains may not be immutable. A cybersecurity event could result in a substantial, immediate and irreversible loss of your Stablecoins. Even a minor cybersecurity event in a Stablecoin is likely to result in a loss of value or ability to redeem a Stablecoin.  </p><p>‍</p><p>4. <strong>Stablecoin Issuers, Intermediaries and Custodians</strong>. Regulation of Stablecoins is constantly evolving. A lack of regulatory oversight creates a risk that an Issuer may not hold enough Fiat Currency to satisfy its obligations to redeem Stablecoins, and that such deficiency may not be easily identified or discovered. In addition, many Issuers and their service providers have experienced significant outages, downtime and processing delays, and may have a higher level of operational risk than traditional financial institutions.  </p><p>‍</p><p>5. <strong>Regulatory Landscape</strong>. Stablecoins currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape. In the United States, Stablecoins are subject to limited federal oversight, and state regulations that apply to Stablecoins vary from state to state and may be inconsistently applied. In addition, Stablecoins may be regulated by additional federal regulators in the future. Such laws and regulations may impact the price of Stablecoins and their acceptance by users, merchants and service providers. </p><p>‍</p><p>6. <strong>Technology</strong>.  The relatively new and rapidly evolving technology underlying Stablecoins introduces unique risks.  For example, a unique private key is required to access, use or transfer a Stablecoin on a Blockchain.  The loss, theft or destruction of a private key may result in an irreversible loss.</p></div></div><div id="w-node-c1d03dad-50a6-131a-fc55-4fa1bd2698fb-33c4f627" class="legal-index-content-wrap"><div class="text-size-large w-richtext"><p><strong>Exhibit C</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>Prohibited Activities</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>You will not use the Bridge Services to undertake or enable by you or any third party (the “<strong><em>Prohibited Activities List</em></strong>”): unlawful or abusive activity, fraud, unlawful gambling, intellectual property infringement, investment or credit services, check cashing, bail bonds, collections agencies, counterfeit or unauthorized goods, drugs and drug paraphernalia (including pseudo pharmaceuticals), substances designed to mimic illegal drugs, adult content and services, multi-level marketing, unfair, predatory or deceptive practices, money services, and any business that Bridge believes poses elevated financial risk, legal liability, or violate card network rules or bank policies.

Any changes to our Privacy Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Website.

This Fee Disclosure Statement outlines the fees associated with our services. We urge you to review this document thoroughly.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>1. Service Charge</strong>. If any of our Partners through which you obtain the Bridge Services opt to levy a fee for the services they provide through our platform, it will be referred to as a Service Charge. The decision to impose such a charge, including its amount, is determined solely by the Partner. For any questions regarding the Service Charge, including its applicability or amount, please reach out directly to the respective Partner for detailed information.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>2. Gas Fees</strong>. Transactions conducted through our platform may entail costs known as &quot;Gas Fees,&quot; associated with computational operations required for transaction execution. These fees are variable, depending on a particular transaction&#x27;s complexity and the prevailing demand on the applicable asset network. Bridge has no control over these networks nor their Gas Fees, which we pass through to you at cost. Given their fluctuating nature, for accurate and current estimates of Gas Fees, please contact the partner through which you are using Bridge, the applicable asset network, and/or a digital asset exchange. Please note, Gas Fees are paid to network transaction validators.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Currency Conversion.</strong> All transactions that necessitate a currency conversion (i.e., denomination in one fiat currency to another), your transaction will be charged a currency spread on top of the actual exchange rate up to 1% of the transaction’s fiat value, which may vary based on transaction. This spread covers currency conversion services to facilitate seamless cross-currency trades.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Please note, the exchange rate shown in the receipt is truncated from the actual exchange rate used in processing the conversion.</strong></p></div></div></div><div id="licenses" class="legal-block"><div class="legal-index-content-wrap"><h3>Licenses</h3><div class="text-size-large text-color-grey">Last Updated 5/22/2024</div><div target="_blank" class="text-size-large w-richtext"><h3>Non-US licenses</h3><p>‍</p><p><strong>Poland</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>Register of Activity in the Scope of Virtual Currencies: RDWW-794</p><p>Bridge Building Sp.

Holding digital and virtual currencies carries exchange rate and other types of risk. Potential users of digital or virtual currencies, including but not limited to Bitcoin, should be forewarned of a possible financial loss at the time that such currencies are exchanged for fiat currency due to an unfavorable exchange rate. A favorable exchange rate at the time of exchange can result in a tax liability. Please consult your tax advisor regarding any tax consequences associated with your holding or use of digital or virtual currencies.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><div class="section-footer"><div class="container-large"><div class="footer-component"><div class="footer-link-wrapper"><a href="/" class="footer-logo-link w-inline-block"><div class="footer-logo w-embed"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 31 31" fill="none" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" aria-hidden="true" role="img">
